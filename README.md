# Gesture_Controlled_Robotic_Arm
 "Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm" where you can control a robotic arm in different angle with the help of MPU6050 (Gyroscopic Sensor). This code will help to determine the angle of X,Y,Z axis of the gyro sensor with minimal drift. Here we have taken another sensor which is Flex sensor also  to control the gripper of the robotic arm
